2.float
3.String
4.boolean
5.complex
6.none

3️⃣ Write a program to store your name, age, and city in variables.

Ans
name = "nisanth"
age = 22
city = "Annur"

print("My name Is :",name)
print("My Age Is :",age)
print("My Palce Is :",city)


4️⃣ What is the output of:

x = 10
print(type(x))

ans
int()


5️⃣ What is the difference between int and float?

int ia an holenumber but float is an decimial number 

6️⃣ What is a boolean data type? Give examples.

boolean has only tow answer which are 0 or 1 which means true or flase
best example is gender 

ex:

male = True
print(male)
print(type(male))

male = True
print(male)
print(type(male))

The program should:

Store student name

Store marks for 3 subjects

Calculate total

Calculate average

Decide grade

Display result clearly

Ans

Student_Name = "Nisanth"
english = 75
tamil = 56
math = 87

total = english+tamil+math
average = total/3

if average > 95:
    grade ="A"

elif average < 85:
    grade ="B"

elif average < 65:
    grade ="C"

else :
    grade ="Try Next Time"


print("Total mark:",total)
print("Average Mark :",average)
print("Grade: ",grade)
