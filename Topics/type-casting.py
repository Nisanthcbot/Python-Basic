# We can convert one data type to another using type casting. In Python, we can use the built-in functions `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc., to perform type casting.

#example of type casting
# Convert a string to an integer

number = "10"

converted_number =int(number)
print(type(converted_number))

#without using any variable 

Phone_number ="7904985936"

print(type(int(Phone_number))) 

"""
 we have to give the datatype which we are converting and inside init we have to give the variable which we want to convert.
